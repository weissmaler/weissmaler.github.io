We are painters, but we love technology. And we embrace people that share our vision and our values:

**Respect**
We face each other as equals. We treat our customers and colleagues in a way that we want to be treated ourselves. We are considerate.

**Team Spirit**
We only reach our goals if we work together. Every single person is important for our mutual success. We can all rely on one another.

**Honesty**
We are honest to ourselves and to our colleagues. We deal with facts and adapt our behavior to comply with them. Face the Facts!

**Optimism**
We are happy to accept challenges even if others think of them as impossible to do. We see opportunities not problems. We do and we make. To do is like to want — just more extreme!

How we achieve what we do?

Easy, we don't only share a set of values that we believe to be essential to a productive and positive work environment, but we also have a structure that allows:

- free flow of information
- short ways of communication
- autonomy and authority to act
- the ability to focus
- room for learning and self improvement
- not limiting but empowering leadership

Those values are the foundation upon which we build our processes and workflows. And this allow us to work efficiently.

## Meetings

Communication and information are important, but so is the ability to focus over long periods of time. This is not only but especially true for software development. We try to be mindful of this need and avoid meetings during productive time periods. There are no meetings in the morning, this period is reserved for productive work. Good time slots are before and after lunch and in the later afternoon.

Please avoid repeating meetings. Each meeting should have a precise agenda. There are some regular team meetings that are informational and will be canceled if not needed.

## Team Events

**Knowledge transfers**
As we grow and get better every day it is crucial that acquired knowledge is shared with other people. We encourage our employees to organize and take part in knowledge transfers. If you identify some knowledge gaps within the team or your own feel free to request or organize a knowledge transfer. This is typically a 1-2 hour event that consists of a presentation and a Q&A session.

**Office interchange**
We have 2 development centers, one in the heart of Berlin and other near the sea, in Porto, Portugal.
To share knowledge and get people together, we promote interchange between the teams, so they can spend the time they need with other coleagues in different offices.

**Fun**

One of our core values is team spirit, therefore it is natural for us, that we often go somewhere to have fun. We experience new things like wakeboarding, laser tag, escape games and much more…
And of course, we have our mythical Summer and Christmas parties in Berlin!

## Coding Philosophy

In general we don’t do quick one-line changes without thinking. Not even for supposedly temporary fixes, since out of experience, most temporary things tend to stay long in your code.

We are not bored, but we try to find the sweet spot between develop good designed, well tested code
have the time to do needed refactoring on the go but keep the speed to be able to do quick changes and new features.
Even when there are critical bugs, you can break things by doing the fix in a rush without thinking.

For us as a startup speed is important, but bad code and breaking things would hit us harder than an extra hour to write a test.

By writing tests we reduce the fear of breaking things in code you never saw. This makes it far easier for new people to develop features or even do refactoring. So keep in mind when writing tests:

write as much tests as are needed that no one can break your feature unintentionally.
try to (partially) replace manual testing with writing the tests directly.
Then you’ll have a good test from the beginning.
